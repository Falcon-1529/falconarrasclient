# A fan-made sequel to diep.io, this time ran by a console controller with swords.

## Requirements:
- A Private Arras Server. (incompatible with kot32 arras servers.)
- Remixed version of this.
# Important: Don't use Name Colors yet because it may reveal your server token. you may still use this template because this template has a few fixes.
****
## Instructions:
- You dont need to touch the server.
1. Navigate to bundle.js, column 3223.
2. Change 'arras-template' to your private server name.
#### If you want Name Colors:
4. Navigate to bundle.js, column 557.
5. Change the "" to "(your token)". Don't use brackets.
Important Note: don't forget to obfuscate or encode your bundle.js or anyone that can visit this client can search and see it. 
- don't forget to credit me :) (jk) (or you can just use a addEventListener w/ keyDown function for that)

## Features and Differences:
- max tanks on upgrade increased. (from 9 to 15) - of course you can edit this based on what numbers you utilize in the server-side arras private server
- Colors (Rainbow = 36, Default 35 Colors, Colored Nests)
- You can use your token with new token input instead of adding it to the link!
- Sharp Edges!
#### v1.0.1:
- Name Colors!
